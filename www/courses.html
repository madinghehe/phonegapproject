    <p class="parallax_description">As a graduate student, I just came to New York last summer from Beijing after graduation. Studying in New York University is totally different from my experience in Tsinghua and Peking University. And I take two elective courses from Courant and Stern.</p>

    <h2><a href="http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~rm3827/websys/courses/Design+and+Development+of+Web+Based+Systems+-+Spring2015.pdf">Design and Development of Web and Mobile Apps</a></h2>
    <p>This course covers application development of a mobile app, starting from a web site and then using
Jquery, Jquery Mobile and phonegap to turn the web site into a fully functioning mobile app. which is
connected to back-end data services. </p>
<p>The sequence of the course will start with creating simple web pages, then customizing the pages using
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). Next, there will be a discussion of client-server computing and how it is
implemented in the world wide web. Alternative processing alternatives will be evaluated. The unix
shell language will be used to demonstrate a simple example of web based processing. Javascript and the
javascript library, JQuery will be used to add dynamic elements to a web page. PhP, ASP and JSP
technologies will be discussed as alternative ways of doing processing on the server. Students need to have a moderate amount of technical background, including at least some programming
experience. Stern courses such as Python programming, Dealing with Data, or Practical Data Science,
taken as pre or co-requisites are sufficient. </p>

<p>Students will have access to a private cloud environment in which
to experiment with their ideas. Custom servers can be built for individual projects, depending on the
needs of the project. Access to the cloud will remain available for 8 months after the course has
officially ended, for those groups who are pursuing financing. </p>
<h2><a href="http://cusp.nyu.edu/curriculum/">Machine Learning for Cities</a></h2>
    <p>The objective of this course is to familiarize students with modern machine learning techniques and demonstrate how they can be applied to urban data. The course is practice-oriented—concepts and techniques are motivated and illustrated by applications to urban problems and datasets. For that reason it involves a significant programming component, with Python as the primary programming language.</p>
<p> Topics include a variety of supervised and unsupervised learning methods, such as support vector machines, neural networks, clustering algorithms, ensemble learning, and advanced regression techniques. Strategies for effective machine learning and discussion of the limitations of ML as well as a variety of supplementary techniques are also considered, including model selection and specification, regularization, dimensionality reduction etc.</p>
<p>

The primary goal of the course is to get students to the point where they: (i) understand the motivation behind different machine learning methods and their applicability in a given practical context; (ii) be able to implement methods adapted to the problem at hand using existing software libraries; and (iii) know how to interpret the results appropriately.</p>

Urban Science Intensive</a></h2>
    <p>The Urban Science Intensive (USI I) is part of a two-semester capstone sequence that is the experiential learning focus of the program. USI I takes place over 14 weeks in the Spring semester and prepares students for delivering Capstone Projects in the summer. The core of the course is team-based work on a real-world urban problem, combining problem identification and evaluation, data collection and analysis, data visualization and communication, and finally, solution formulation and testing. This project-based course begins with the Social Impact Project, where students are introduced and immersed in problem definition and project delivery skills. The course also lays the foundation for the Capstone Projects, where students work on integrated teams with Agency and Industry Partners, immersed in the public aspects of the project.
</p>
<p>
The Urban Science Intensive I course introduces students to their projects and the Agency and Industry mentors involved and develops team-building; students meet with various officials at the relevant agencies and industry partners, tour relevant projects and facilities, and begin to engage the community; student teams define the problem and craft a strategy to identify solutions, inventory available and needed datasets, and explore possibilities for new instrumentation and citizen engagement to support project objectives. This course involves a combination of lectures, student team project work, in-class group work, site visits, and guest speakers.</p>
